# Customer Segmentation and Marketing Analysis for Retail Store

The "Customer Segmentation and Marketing Analysis for Retail Store" project aims to perform customer segmentation and analyze marketing strategies in a retail store. The project utilizes unsupervised clustering techniques and exploratory data analysis to identify groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior, personal characteristics, and spending patterns.

The project begins by understanding and cleaning the customer data, including handling missing values and converting categorical features into numerical form. Next, dimensionality reduction is performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the data and visualize the results in 3D.

Following that, the clustering process is conducted using Agglomerative Clustering method to group customers into clusters. These clusters are then profiled to understand the characteristics of each customer group, such as spending levels, age, family status, and income level.

Furthermore, marketing analysis is performed by examining the performance of previous campaigns, the number of promotions accepted by customers, and purchasing patterns of specific products. The analysis provides insights into customer response to campaigns, purchasing preferences, and opportunities for more effective marketing strategies.

The project is implemented using Python programming language and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and seaborn for data manipulation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization. It helps the retail store develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize profits by leveraging customer segmentation and a deep understanding of the characteristics of each customer group.
